# Racing Line Finder
When racing, it's important to know where to position yourself on the track, where to brake and accelerate. For new racers, or simply new tracks this can be challenging and figuring this out can be time-consuming. This project aims to find the most optimal racing line around a track. 

## Setup:
This project requires you to have python installed
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Raphael-W/Racing-Line.git
```

2. Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pygame jsonschema numpy
```

3. Run `main.py`

## Track Designer

- Right click to remove the point
<!-- -->
- Hold down the scroll wheel to pan
